      "message": "For our use case, we don\u0027t really need this. The srpm used to import was created using the mock configuration downloaded from brew, so the disttag is already correct.\n\nFor a more general case... Yes, if the mock configuration is not downloaded, we could have different disttags, but I\u0027m not sure if this would justify the extra effort.",
