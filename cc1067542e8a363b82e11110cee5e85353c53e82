      "message": "I think symlinks are okay to start with yes, but sounds like we might need to whiteboard how DLRN would look under this new format. If we now assume ~/src/review.r.o is where git repos now are cloned from, I am assuming we can tell mock to change the location of where logs are stored too.\n\nIf we can avoid moving data during a job build, we\u0027ll get fast run time. We also have the ability now for much smarter log collection",
