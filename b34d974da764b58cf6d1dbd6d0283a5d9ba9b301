As of now we set the package name from the spec file name and if the directory name can be different from the package name then I think that\u0027s fine. Next PS remove the use of a var named \u0027package\u0027 line 64. Let me know if this is fine.",

      "message": "The main issue we had here is consistency. In my test, I had a directory data/test under the DLRN tree, where I had my test spec (called dlrn.spec). When running this, package was initially set to \"test\" (instead of dlrn), so it tried to copy everything to data/test, and failed.\n\nInstead of that, if we had done:\n\npackage, version \u003d self._get_infos_from_pkg(src_dir)\n\nin this line, we\u0027d have package\u003ddlrn and the right version already. With this, it would have tried to copy the spec to data/dlrn, and everything would have flowed correctly.\n\nThe new patchset still has the same issue with dest_dir, so it would try to copy the spec file to data/test.",
