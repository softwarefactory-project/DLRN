# This file describes the access control lists for DLRN API operations
# There are some basic rules:
# 1- Each API call needs to have a corresponding entry here, in the form
#    "api_url:method": ACL
# 2- If the entry for the API call is missing, any access will be denied
# 3- The ACL can look like the following:
#    - [] (empty list), that means all users can do it
#    - A list of usernames (only for POST operations), so only those users
#      can use the API call.
#    - The special keyword "deny_all" to deny the operation to all users
#
# Example rules:
# "/api/repo_status:GET": []               (full access)
# "/api/repo_status:GET": deny_all         (API call is effectively disabled)
# "/api/last_tested_repo:POST":            (Allowed for user1 and user2)
#   - user1
#   - user2

# An empty list means everyone can do it
"/api/repo_status:GET": []
"/api/last_tested_repo:GET": []
"/api/promotions:GET": []
"/api/metrics/builds:GET": []
"/api/civotes.html:GET": []
"/api/civotes_detail.html:GET": []
"/api/report.html:GET": []

# An empty list on a POST action means any authenticated user can do it
"/api/last_tested_repo:POST": []
"/api/report_result:POST": []
"/api/remote/import:POST": []
"/api/promote:POST": []
