      "message": "First, I\u0027d store this magical URL string in a variable - it might be useful.\n\nSecond, I suggest an alignment with distroinfo.\n\nIf multiple *_info parameters are passed to DistroInfo constructor, it selects the fastest one available which results in this precedence:\n\nlocal_info \u003e remote_info \u003e remote_git_info\n\nlocal_info is called local_info_repo here.\nlocat_git_info is called rdoinfo_repo here.\nso if you put the remote_info URL into a config option such as rdoinfo_raw or such, you can simply grab the opts from config and feed them directly to DistroInfo() - effectively replacing this block with\n\ninforepo \u003d info.DistroInfo(\n    info_files\u003d\u0027rdo.yml\u0027,\n    local_info\u003dlocal_info_repo,\n    remote_info\u003drdoinfo_raw,\n    remote_git_info\u003drdoinfo_repo)\n\nas long as you like the builtin precedence of direct remote_info to remote_git_info (it\u0027s the other way around in this code).\n\nIf none of the strings are supplied, DistroInfo will throw\ndistroinfo.exception.InfoFetcherRequired() back at you ;)",
