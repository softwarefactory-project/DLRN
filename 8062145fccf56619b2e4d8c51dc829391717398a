      "message": "I especially like this factorization. A single magical script is used to build SRPM which is a normalized format. One can reuse this script or the resulting SRPM in any way (s)he see fit.\n\nThe most useful (for us :]) building methods are going to be available separately in a reusable and extensible way.\n\nIMHO splitting the SRPM build from the RPM build itself and making the builders modular is a huge improvement.",
