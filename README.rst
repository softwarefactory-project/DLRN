DLRN
====

DLRN builds and maintains yum repositories following OpenStack
uptream commit streams. (DLRN is not an acronym or an abbreviation,
and it can be pronounced "dee el arr en".)

Documentation is available at
http://dlrn.readthedocs.org/en/latest/

Setup
-----

.. code-block:: shell-session

    # yum install git createrepo python-virtualenv mock gcc \
                  redhat-rpm-config rpmdevtools httpd libffi-devel \
                  openssl-devel

Add the user you intend to run as to the mock group and login again.

.. code-block:: shell-session

    $ git clone https://github.com/openstack-packages/DLRN.git

If you want to serve the built packages and the status reports, enable the
httpd service, and then either add a section in the server configuration to
map a URL to the data directories, or create a symbolic link:

.. code-block:: shell-session

    # systemctl start httpd
    # cd /var/www/html
    # ln -s <datadir>/repos .

Preparing
---------

.. code-block:: shell-session

    $ cd DLRN
    $ virtualenv ../dlrn-venv
    $ . ../dlrn-venv/bin/activate
    $ pip install --upgrade pip
    $ pip install -r requirements.txt
    $ python setup.py develop


Edit ``projects.ini`` if needed.

Bootstrapping
-------------

Some of the projects require others to build. As a result, use the
special option ``--order`` to build in the order computed from the
BuildRequires and Requires fields of the spec files when you bootstrap
your repository.

.. code-block:: shell-session

    $ dlrn --order

When using this special option, a special variable ``repo_bootstrap``
is defined in the specs, with a value of 1. You can use this variable if
needed, to break dependency loops between packages. For example:

.. code-block:: spec

    %if 0%{?repo_bootstrap} == 0
    BuildRequires: package-with-circular-dependency
    %endif

Running
-------

Once all the packages have been built once, you can get back to build
the packages in the order of the timestamps of the commits.

.. code-block:: shell-session

    $ dlrn

Troubleshooting
---------------

If you interrupt dlrn during mock build you might get an error

.. code-block:: shell-session

    OSError: [Errno 16] Device or resource busy: '/var/lib/mock/dlrn-fedora-x86_64/root/var/cache/yum'

Solution is to clear left-over bind mount as root:

.. code-block:: shell-session

    # umount /var/lib/mock/dlrn-fedora-x86_64/root/var/cache/yum

Other requirements
------------------

If the git clone operation fails for a package, DLRN will try to remove
the source directory using sudo. Please make sure the user running DLRN
can run ``rm -rf /path/to/dlrn/data/*`` without being asked for a password,
otherwise DLRN will fail to process new commits.
