After applying my linting hints, that is ;)\n\nThis snippet will see quite some use I reckon. Information about preferred python interpreter has been available on Debian systems through simple `alternatives` symlink (alongside system to support multiple python versions for each python package) for ages, but I fail to find a decent alternative on Fedora systems. If there is no such thing, we\u0027re gonna need this code all over the place, I wonder how to centralize and not mass duplicate it...",
